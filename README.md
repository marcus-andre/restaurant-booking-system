### 5. System Feedback (User Notifications)
The application provides immediate feedback for all user interactions, ensuring the user is always aware of the system's status. This includes success messages for authentication and CRUD operations.

    ![Booking Update Success](./documentation/user-booking-update-system-notification%20.jpg)

### 6. Booking Management & Defensive Design
Users have full control over their reservations with a dedicated edit interface. To prevent accidental data loss, the system employs defensive design principles by requesting confirmation before destructive actions.

* **Edit Reservation**: Users are presented with a pre-filled form to easily modify their booking details.

* **Defensive Design (Confirmation Modals)**: Before logging out or deleting a booking, a modal appears to confirm the user's intent.

## 🗄️ Data Model

The project uses a relational database (PostgreSQL). The primary custom model is **Booking**, which is linked to the standard Django **User** model.

![Entity Relationship Diagram](./documentation/erd.png)

> *The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) above was designed using dbdiagram.io to illustrate the relationship between User and Booking models.*

### Project Structure & Organization
* **Documentation Directory**: A dedicated `documentation/` folder was created to store screenshots, mockups, and planning assets used in this README. This decision was made to keep the production `static/` folder clean and optimized, ensuring it contains only files necessary for the deployed application's performance.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Tools
Based on the project's requirements, the following tools were implemented in the virtual environment:

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Django (4.2.17)** | The core framework used for the application logic. |
| **Gunicorn** | WSGI HTTP Server used for production on Heroku. |
| **Cloudinary** | Cloud service used to serve optimized media assets. |
| **Django-Cloudinary-Storage** | Manages storage for both media and static assets (CSS/JS) without needing WhiteNoise. |
| **Psycopg2-binary** | PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. |
| **Django-allauth** | Handles user authentication and account management. |
| **Django-Crispy-Forms** | Controls the rendering of forms using Bootstrap 5 styling. |

## 🚀 Deployment Procedure

The project was deployed using **Heroku**. The live link can be found here: [Pearl & Truffle Live Site](https://pearl-and-truffle-booking-860a3739edd9.herokuapp.com/)

### Prerequisites
To deploy this project, you need:
1.  A **Heroku** account.
2.  A **Cloudinary** account (for hosting static and media files).
3.  A **PostgreSQL** database (provided by Code Institute).

### Deploying to Heroku
The following steps were taken to deploy the application:

1.  **Prepare the Environment**:
    * Created a `requirements.txt` file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` so Heroku knows which packages to install.
    * Created a `Procfile` containing `web: gunicorn restaurant_booking.wsgi` to instruct Heroku how to run the app.

2.  **Create the Heroku App**:
    * Logged into Heroku and clicked **"New"** -> **"Create new app"**.
    * Chose a unique name (`pearl-and-truffle-booking`) and selected the **Europe** region.

3.  **Configure Environment Variables (Config Vars)**:
    * Navigated to the **Settings** tab and located the **"Config Vars"** section.
    * Clicked **"Reveal Config Vars"** and added the following keys:
        * `DATABASE_URL`: The URL provided by the **Code Institute** PostgreSQL instance.
        * `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for Django security.
        * `CLOUDINARY_URL`: The API Environment variable from the Cloudinary dashboard.
        * `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`: `1` (Temporary, used only during initial deployment if static files cause issues).

4.  **Connect to GitHub**:
    * Navigated to the **Deploy** tab.
    * Selected **GitHub** as the deployment method.
    * Searched for the repository `restaurant-booking-system` and clicked **Connect**.

5.  **Manual Deploy**:
    * Scrolled down to the **"Manual deploy"** section.
    * Selected the `main` branch and clicked **"Deploy Branch"**.
    * Once finished, a "Your app was successfully deployed" message appeared with a button to view the live site.

## 🐞 Fixed Issues & Troubleshooting
Documentation of critical fixes during development:

* **Procfile Error**: Re-created the file with ASCII encoding to solve Heroku parsing issues.
