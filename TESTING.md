# Testing & Validation

Return to [README.md](README.md)

## ✅ Code Validation

### HTML Validation (W3C)
To ensure compliance, the HTML code was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

**Methodology**:
Since Django templates (`.html`) contain Jinja2 logic that creates false errors in the validator, the validation was performed by:
1. Opening the live deployed page.
2. Right-clicking to "View Page Source".
3. Copying the raw rendered HTML into the W3C Validator via "Direct Input".

**Result**:
No errors were found in the custom code across key pages.

**Summary of Checked Pages**:

| Page | Result | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Home Page** | ✅ Pass | Screenshot above |
| **Register / Login** | ✅ Pass | Allauth forms render correctly |
| **Booking Form** | ✅ Pass | CSRF tokens and form fields are valid |
| **My Bookings** | ✅ Pass | Table structure is valid |
| **Edit Booking** | ✅ Pass | Pre-filled values render correctly |

### CSS Validation (Jigsaw)
The CSS file was tested using the [W3C Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
* **Result**: Passed with no errors.

### Python Validation (CI Linter)
All custom Python files were checked using the **Code Institute Python Linter** to ensure compliance with PEP8 standards.

**Methodology**:
I manually copied the code from each python file and pasted it into the CI Python Linter.

**Result**:
All files passed with no critical errors.
* *Note: `settings.py` may contain "line too long" warnings due to unavoidable Django configuration strings (like AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS), which is acceptable practice.*

**Evidence (Example: `views.py`)**

**Summary of Checked Files**:

| File | Result | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **booking/views.py** | ✅ Pass | Zero errors |
| **booking/models.py** | ✅ Pass | Zero errors |
| **booking/forms.py** | ✅ Pass | Zero errors |

**Summary of Results:**
The application achieved high scores across all metrics, ensuring a fast and accessible user experience.

* **Performance:** 99
* **Accessibility:** 95
* **Best Practices:** 100
* **SEO:** 90
